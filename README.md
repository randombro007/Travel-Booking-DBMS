# Travel-Booking-DBMS
Our project on Travel Booking for the DBMS endsem Project
We have used HTML, PHP, CSS and XAMPP server(For the SQL database connection)
The project is divided into two parts: 1.Login and Sign-in page 
                                       2.HTML form for booking 
                                       3.A frontend for the travel website (we could not connect it to the backend server and use it for signing up)
To run the code you need to open it in your code editor and get the XAMPP server running on your localhost (8080 specifically) and create the databases login_db(for test1 folder) and message_db(for test2 folder)
